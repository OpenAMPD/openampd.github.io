# OpenAMPD

The **Open Archive of Middle Persian Documents** (OpenAMPD) is an online archive and digital edition of Middle Persian documents preserved in collections around the world. Its goal is to make transcriptions, translations, and images of the texts available to the wider public, and in doing so to encourage and facilitate further research on these valuable and understudied texts. OpenAMPD makes use of TEI.  

The core of this project is the 300+ Middle Persian documents held at UC Berkeley in the Bancroft Library (sometimes referred to as the “Pahlavi Archive”), but will also include documents held in other collections which are likely to belong to the same original find. It is our goal that OpenAMPD will also eventually be extended to the Middle Persian documents in further collections around the world and also include the Middle Persian papyri and ostraca.
